Codebase Memory MCP Server Usage Guide
======================================

Overview:
---------
This MCP server indexes and remembers your entire codebase located at:
c:/Users/crypt/CascadeProjects/bumbot

It provides tools and resources to search and retrieve code files efficiently.

How to Use:
-----------

1. Searching the Codebase:
   - Use the "search_codebase" tool.
   - Provide a regex pattern as input.
   - The server will return a list of files containing matches along with code snippets.

   Example command:
   {
     "tool": "search_codebase",
     "arguments": {
       "pattern": "functionName"
     }
   }

2. Retrieving File Contents:
   - Access resources using URIs in the format:
     file://<full_path_to_file>
   - The server returns the full text content of the requested file.

   Example URI:
   file://c:/Users/crypt/CascadeProjects/bumbot/src/codebase_memory/snapshot_versioning.py

3. Integration:
   - You can invoke these tools and resources programmatically via the MCP protocol.
   - Alternatively, you can ask me to perform searches or retrieve files on your behalf.

Example Queries You Can Ask Me:
--------------------------------
- "Search for all occurrences of 'def ' in the codebase."
- "Show me the contents of 'src/codebase_memory/change_detection.py'."
- "Find all files mentioning 'snapshot'."

Notes:
------
- The server excludes common folders like node_modules, .git, dist, and build.
- Regex patterns are case-insensitive.
- Snippets returned are the first 200 characters of the matching file content.

If you want, I can demonstrate a search or file retrieval now.
